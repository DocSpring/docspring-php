## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **string** | The signature request's ID. |
**submission_id** | **string** | The ID of the submission the signature request belongs to. |
**name** | **string** | The name of the person the request is for. |
**email** | **string** | Their email address. |
**fields** | **string[]** | The fields this person fills in. Null for a signature request created with API v1 without a field list: it asks for every field the submission's data doesn't have. |
**metadata** | **array<string,mixed>** | Your own data about the signature request, such as an ID from your app. |
**role** | **string** | Which of the template's signers the person is. Until templates have roles of their own, a template's signers are `Signer 1`, `Signer 2` and so on, up to `Signer 100`: `Signer 1` is the one whose details the template's `@@signature_requests/0` fields print. |
**sort_order** | **int** | The signer's position, from 0: `Signer 1` is 0. The template's `@@signature_requests/&lt;sort_order&gt;` fields print this signature request's details. |
**state** | [**\DocSpring\Model\SignatureRequestState**](SignatureRequestState.md) | `pending` until the person completes the signature request (`completed`) or declines it (`declined`). |
**data** | **array<string,mixed>** | The values this person entered for their own fields (`fields`). Null when their submission's data is left out: in lists without `include_data=true`, in the events of a webhook that leaves out submission data, and once the submission has expired. |
**viewed_at** | **\DateTime** | When the person first opened the signature request. |
**completed_at** | **\DateTime** | When they completed it. |
**declined_at** | **\DateTime** | When they declined it. |
**auth_type** | [**\DocSpring\Model\SignatureRequestAuthType**](SignatureRequestAuthType.md) | How your app authenticated the person before it showed them the signature request. |
**auth_second_factor_type** | [**\DocSpring\Model\SignatureRequestAuthSecondFactorType**](SignatureRequestAuthSecondFactorType.md) | The second factor your app authenticated them with, if any. |
**auth_provider** | **string** | The service that authenticated them, such as `google`. Required when `auth_type` is `oauth`. |
**auth_session_started_at** | **\DateTime** | When your app authenticated them. Set for you with `email_link`. |
**auth_session_id_hash** | **string** | A hash of your app's session ID, for the audit trail. |
**auth_user_id_hash** | **string** | Their user ID in your app, or a SHA-256 hash of a salt and the user ID. |
**auth_username_hash** | **string** | Their username in your app, or a SHA-256 hash of a salt and the username. |
**auth_phone_number_hash** | **string** | The phone number they authenticated with, or a SHA-256 hash of a salt and the phone number. |
**ip_address** | **string** | The IP address they completed the signature request from. Null in the events of a webhook that leaves out submission data. |
